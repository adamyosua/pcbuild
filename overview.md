# PC Build Documentation

This is a repo to keep track of my pc build. This page is written in markdown. A good cross platform real time render of markdown you can use to read this page is Typora.

## Starter Websites
- [buildapc subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/index)
- [PC part picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/)
- [choose a PC](https://choosemypc.net/)
- [PC builds](https://pc-builds.com/)

I looked at [logical increments website](https://www.logicalincrements.com/) and saw that the **very good** level ($780) would be about what I am looking for price wise. I think if I can get maybe 2 more similar starting points that would be a good idea. Then I can start tweaking it and looking in more detail. I also have have to keep in mind I will want to buy 2 monitors ($100 - $200) and a monitor stand (27$). This would put me a total of $1k.

## Things that I plan on using my PC for

- run of the mill office work (local spreadsheets, word docs picuture/ video playing/ management)
- windows/linux development
- FPGA development (heavy use of multithreading and CPU usage). I need to link what Xilinx reccomends here. I know that in general heavy CPU usage is present.
- Personal data storage managment (volumous disk usage)
- PCB development. Requirements are on [this page](https://www.kicad-pcb.org/help/system-requirements/). They don't have heavy recommendations but I need to be aware that my graphics card supports openGL or some shit like that.

## CPU
The very good level of logical instruments budgets $170 for their rizen CPU. I was using [PC part picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) to find similar priced CPUs that fit my needs.

My needs for a CPU:

- multicore (needed for FPGA development)
- strong linux compatibility
- better than my laptop processor from 2013 (idealy more cores, faster clock more modern fab, i5 level or higher)

My wants:

- over clock ability
-
