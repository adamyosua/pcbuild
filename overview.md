# PC Build Overview

This is a repository to document my PC build. This page is written in markdown. A good cross platform real time render of markdown you can use to read this page is Typora.

## Starter Websites
- [r/buildapc](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/index) 
  - good for general information
- [PC part picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/)
  - good for filtering parts and making alternative selections
- [choose a PC](https://choosemypc.net/)
- [PC builds](https://pc-builds.com/)
  - This website has some decent calculators on it
- [r/buildapcforme](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/)
  - Get a PC build that can be used to compare against your build
- [logical increments website](https://www.logicalincrements.com/)
  - good for getting an idea of what your budget can get you (would also be a good buy if you don't want something very custom)

## Plan

#### 1) List out requirements and use case of my PC

- given by requirements.md
- I looked at would be about what I am looking for price wise. I think if I can get maybe 2 more similar starting points that would be a good idea. Then I can start tweaking it and looking in more detail. I also have have to keep in mind I will want to buy 2 monitors ($100 - $200) and a monitor stand (27$). This would put me a total of $1k.


#### 2) Come up with a budget from a generic build on logical Increments

- I am aiming for my full budget to be $1k. This includes two monitors, a monitor stand, and a mouse. I already have a keyboard.
- The "*very good*" level on the [logical increments website](https://www.logicalincrements.com/) (which is about $780) is a good starting point

#### 3) Start swapping out parts where I need more customization to come up with pre rough draft

- part list and documentation is in /roughDraft/currentPartList.md

#### 4) Iterate on that design with some research

#### 5) Finalize rough draft

#### 6) Submit a post to r/buildapcforme

#### 7) Submit build to r/buildapc

#### 8) Purchase the damn thing
