This is a repo to keep track of my pc build. 

## Starter Websites
- [buildapc subreddit] (https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/index)
- [PC part picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/)
- [choose a PC](https://choosemypc.net/)

I looked at [logical increments website](https://www.logicalincrements.com/) and saw that the very good level ($780) would be about what I am looking for price wise. I think if I can get maybe 2 more similar starting points that would be a good idea. Then I can start tweaking it and looking in more detail. I also have have to keep in mind I will want to buy 2 monitors ($100 - $200) and a monitor stand (27$). This would put me a total of $1k.

## CPU
This section lists my thoughts on what CPU I should buy
