# Current Part List

## Graphics Card

## CPU

The very good level of logical instruments budgets $170 for their rizen CPU. I was using [PC part picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) to find similar priced CPUs that fit my needs.

I would like an intel CPU because I think that would be more compatible with linux [add corraborating link]

## HSF

If I am going to overclock I will probably want to buy a HSF that can support the max power output of the maxed overclocking of my CPU if I can afford it. I should probably prioritize my wants/needs at some point....

EDIT: I think for now I am going to stick with the one they recommend. If I decide to overclock I can always change it.
