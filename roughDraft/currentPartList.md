I would like an intel CPU because I think that would be more compatible with linux [add corraborating link]

## HSF

If I am going to overclock I will probably want to buy a HSF that can support the max power output of the maxed overclocking of my CPU if I can afford it. I should probably prioritize my wants/needs at some point....
