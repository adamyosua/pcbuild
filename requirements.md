# Requirements

## Use Case

- run of the mill office work (local spreadsheets, word docs picuture/ video playing/ management)
- windows/linux development
- FPGA development (heavy use of multithreading and CPU usage). I need to link what Xilinx reccomends here. I know that in general heavy CPU usage is present.
- Personal data storage managment (volumous disk usage)
- PCB development. Requirements are on [this page](https://www.kicad-pcb.org/help/system-requirements/). They don't have heavy recommendations but I need to be aware that my graphics card supports openGL or some shit like that.

## Hardware Requirements

### Needs

- multicore (needed for FPGA development)
- strong linux compatibility
- better than my laptop processor from 2013 (idealy more cores, faster clock more modern fab, i5 level or higher)

### Wants

- Over clocking

## Software Requirements
